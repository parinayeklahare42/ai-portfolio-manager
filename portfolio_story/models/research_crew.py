The Research Crew - AI/ML Analysis Engine
========================================

This module implements the core AI/ML analysis engine for the Portfolio Management System.
It performs comprehensive analysis of financial assets using multiple machine learning
techniques and statistical methods to score and rank assets for portfolio optimization.

Key AI/ML Techniques:
- Momentum Analysis: 6-month price trend analysis using statistical methods
- Volatility Modeling: Risk assessment using rolling volatility calculations
- Drawdown Analysis: Maximum loss potential evaluation using peak-to-trough analysis
- Sentiment Analysis: News and market sentiment analysis using NLP techniques

The Research Crew uses a composite scoring system that combines all analysis
dimensions to provide a comprehensive ranking of assets for portfolio selection.

    The Research Crew performs comprehensive AI/ML analysis of financial assets.
    
    This class implements the core machine learning analysis engine that evaluates
    assets across multiple dimensions to provide intelligent scoring and ranking.
    The analysis combines traditional financial metrics with modern AI techniques
    to create a comprehensive asset evaluation system.
    
    Analysis Framework:
    1. Momentum Analysis (6 months): Statistical trend analysis using price movements
    2. Volatility Analysis (20 days): Risk assessment using rolling volatility
    3. Drawdown Analysis (1 year): Maximum loss potential using peak-to-trough analysis
    4. Sentiment Analysis: NLP-based news sentiment analysis using TextBlob
    
    The Research Crew uses a composite scoring system that weights all analysis
    dimensions equally to provide a balanced evaluation of each asset. This
    approach ensures that no single factor dominates the analysis, leading to
    more robust and diversified portfolio selections.
    
    Key Features:
    - Machine learning-based asset scoring
    - Multi-dimensional analysis framework
    - Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques

        Calculate momentum score using statistical trend analysis.
        
        This method implements a sophisticated momentum analysis that evaluates
        the price trend over a specified lookback period. The momentum score
        is calculated using percentage price change and converted to a 0-1 scale
        using a sigmoid function for better ML compatibility.
        
        The momentum analysis is crucial for identifying assets with strong
        upward trends, which are typically preferred in portfolio optimization
        as they indicate positive market sentiment and potential for continued
        performance.
        
        Mathematical Approach:
        1. Calculate percentage change over lookback period
        2. Apply sigmoid transformation: 1 / (1 + exp(-momentum * scale_factor))
        3. Scale factor of 10 provides good sensitivity to price changes

        This method implements risk assessment through volatility analysis,

        volatility assets receive higher scores as they are considered safer
        investments with more predictable returns.
        
        The volatility analysis uses annualized standard deviation of daily
        returns to measure price stability. This approach is widely used in
        financial risk management and portfolio optimization.
        
        Mathematical Approach:
        1. Calculate daily returns: (price_t - price_t-1) / price_t-1
        2. Compute rolling standard deviation of returns
        3. Annualize volatility: std_dev * sqrt(252 trading days)
